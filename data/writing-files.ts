// The easiest way to write a file, is to dump an entire buffer into the file at
// once.
const bytes = new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]);
await Deno.writeFile("hello.txt", bytes, { mode: 0o644 });

// You can also write a string instead of a byte array.
await Deno.writeTextFile("hello.txt", "Hello World");

// Synchronous writing is also supported.
Deno.writeFileSync("hello.txt", bytes);
Deno.writeTextFileSync("hello.txt", "Hello World");

// For more granular writes, open a new file for writing.
const file = await Deno.create("hello.txt");

// You can write chunks of data to the file.
const written = await file.write(bytes);
console.log(`${written} bytes written.`);

// A `file.write` returns the number of bytes written, as it might not write all
// bytes passed. We can get a Writer insteda to make sure the entire buffer is written.
const writer = file.writable.getWriter();
await writer.write(new TextEncoder().encode("World!"));

// Closing the writer automatically closes the file.
// If you don't use a writer, make sure to close the file after you are done with it.
await writer.close();

// The `--allow-write` permission is required to write files.
