// The easiest way to watch a filesystem is to use the Deno builtin watchFs.
// Deno.watchFs returns an FsWatcher which is an async iterable.
let watcher = Deno.watchFs("./");

// The easiest way to interact with async iterables is the javascript for await of syntax.
for await (const event of watcher) {
  console.log(">>>> event", event);

  // To stop the watcher we can simply call `watcher.close()`
  watcher.close();
}

// In real applications, it is quite rare that an application needs to react
// to every change instantly. Events will be duplicated and multiple events will
// be dispatched for the same changes. To get around this, we can "debounce" our
// functions.
import { debounce } from "jsr:@std/async/debounce";

// In this specific case, we use the standard library to do the work for us.
// This function will run at most once every two hundred milliseconds
const log = debounce((event: Deno.FsEvent) => {
  console.log("[%s] %s", event.kind, event.paths[0]);
}, 200);

watcher = Deno.watchFs("./");

for await (const event of watcher) {
  log(event);
}
