// thread and do some processing as a result of them.

// Currently, Deno only supports module-type workers. To instantiate one
// we can use similar syntax to what is found on the web.
const worker = new Worker(

// We can send a message to the worker by using the `postMessage` method
worker.postMessage({ filename: "./log.txt" });

// By default the worker inherits the permissions of the thread it was
// instantiated from. We can give workers certain permissions by using
// the deno.permissions option.
const worker2 = new Worker(
  new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url).href,

        ],
      },

// Because we instantiated this worker with specific permissions, this will
// cause the worker to try to read a file it doesn't have access to and thus
// will throw a permission error.
