// The Deno ecosystem has a convention to re-export all remote dependencies from
// a deps.ts file at the root of the repo. This keeps remote dependencies
// organized, and in a single place.

export * as path from "https://deno.land/std@0.114.0/path/mod.ts";

// File: ./main.ts

// Other files can then import dependencies from the deps.ts file.

import { path } from "./deps.ts";

// Doing this makes package version upgrades really easy, as all external
// dependency specifiers live in the same file.
