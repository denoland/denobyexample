// In the most simple case, we can just request a permission by it's name.
// In this case, we ask for --allow-env and prompt the user. The user will
// not be prompted if it was already allowed in the past and not revoked.
let status = await Deno.permissions.request({ name: "env" });
if (status.state === "granted") {

  console.log("'env' permission is denied.");

// We can also query permissions without asking for them. In this case,
// we are querying whether or not we have the read permission. Not only
// can we query whether we have a permission or not, we can even specify
// what directories we have permissions in using the path option.
const readStatus = await Deno.permissions.query({
  name: "read",
  path: "/etc",

console.log(readStatus.state);

// In the case that we no longer need a permission, it is also possible
// to revoke a process's access to that permission. This is useful when
// a process starts running untrusted code.
